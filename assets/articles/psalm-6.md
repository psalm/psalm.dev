[Psalm](https://psalm.dev) is one of the biggest and most powerful PHP Static analysis tools, featuring exclusive features like [security analysis](https://psalm.dev/docs/security_analysis/).

**Psalm v6** brings support for PHP 8.4, AMPHP v3, PHP-Parser v5 and much more!   

I am happy to announce that I, [Daniil Gentili](https://daniil.it), am now the main maintainer of Psalm, and thanks to the newly launched [Psalm support contracts](https://psalm.dev/support), I now have the opportunity to work heavily on Psalm, specifically focusing on major performance improvements and improved [security analysis](https://psalm.dev/docs/security_analysis/).  

This post is the first of a series of **technical deep dives** into Psalm v6's performance improvements, which will be released over the next weeks, starting with:
