[Psalm](https://psalm.dev) is one of the biggest and most powerful PHP Static analysis tools, featuring exclusive features like [security analysis](https://psalm.dev/docs/security_analysis/), and in [Psalm 6.3](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/releases/tag/6.3.0), a new tool called [psalm-review](https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/command_line_usage/#reviewing-issues-in-your-ide-of-choice) was added.  

It allows users to manually review found issues one by one in your favorite IDE: just start it on a JSON report generated by Psalm, and it will open your preferred IDE on the exact line and column where the issue occurred:

```
./vendor/bin/psalm-review report.json code|phpstorm|code-server [ inv|rev|[~-]IssueType1 ] [ [~-]IssueType2 ] ...
```

The tool may also be run using the main `psalm` entry point, useful for example when working with the phar:

```
./vendor/bin/psalm.phar --review report.json code|phpstorm|code-server [ inv|rev|[~-]IssueType1 ] [ [~-]IssueType2 ] ...
```

The extra arguments may be used to filter only for issues of the specified types, or for all issues except the specified types (with the `~` or `-` inversion).

The `rev` or `inv` keywords may be used to start from the end of the report instead of at the beginning.
