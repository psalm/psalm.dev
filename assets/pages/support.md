## Support Psalm

Announcing Psalm's new **support model**: you can support Psalm development by requesting a support contract from [Daniil Gentili](https://daniil.it), the maintainer of Psalm.  

Support contracts can cover full integration of Psalm into existing codebases, support for Psalm issues and development of additional Psalm features.
